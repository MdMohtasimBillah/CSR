# The Cancer Study Repository

The Cancer Study Repository is a comprehensive collection of resources, datasets, code, and documentation aimed at facilitating research and analysis in the field of cancer biology and oncology. This repository serves as a centralized hub for researchers, clinicians, and data scientists to collaborate, share insights, and advance our understanding of cancer.

## Important Concepts 
1. **Gene Symbol:** This column contains symbols representing genes, typically short identifiers used to represent genes in various databases and analyses.
2. **GeneID:** This column contains the unique identifiers associated with genes. In this dataset, it appears to be using Ensembl gene IDs, which are standardized identifiers for genes in the Ensembl database.
3. **Median Tumor:** This column likely represents the median expression level of each gene in tumor samples. It's a numeric value representing the median expression level.
4. **Median Normal:** This column likely represents the median expression level of each gene in normal (non-tumor) samples. Similar to "MedianTumor", it's a numeric value representing the median expression level.
5. **Log2Fold Change:** This column typically represents the log2-fold change in gene expression between tumor and normal samples. It's a measure of how much the expression of a gene changes between the two conditions.
6. **adjp:** This column likely contains adjusted p-values associated with each gene, often used in statistical analyses to determine if the observed differences in gene expression are statistically significant after adjusting for multiple testing.


## Visualizations (What? Why? How?)
### MA Plot (M vs A Plot)
- **What:** An MA plot represents the log-fold change (M) on the y-axis and the average expression (A) on the x-axis for each gene or feature.
- **Why:** It is used to visualize differential expression between two conditions.The log-fold change (M) gives an idea of the magnitude of change, and the average expression (A) helps identify if the change is dependent on the expression level.
- **Interpretation:**
  - Each point is a gene.
  
  - Genes with big expression differences are far from the center.
  
  - Genes upregulated in one condition are above the center line.
  
  - Genes downregulated are below the center line.
  
  - Genes with no change cluster around the center.

### Volcano Plot
- **What:** A volcano plot is a graphical method used to visualize the results of statistical tests, such as t-tests or ANOVA, conducted on high-throughput data, such as gene expression data. It displays both the statistical significance (usually represented as -log10(p-value) on the y-axis) and the magnitude of change (e.g., log2 fold change) between two conditions on the x-axis.
- **Why:** A volcano plot is used to quickly identify genes or features that are significantly differentially expressed between two conditions. It provides a clear visualization of both the statistical significance and the biological relevance of the differences.
- **Interpretation:**
  - Each point on the plot represents a gene or feature.
  
  - The x-axis typically shows the magnitude of change between conditions (e.g., log2 fold change), with points farther from zero indicating larger differences.
  
  - The y-axis shows the statistical significance of the differences, often represented as the negative logarithm of the p-value. Points higher on the plot represent greater significance.
  
  - Genes with both high significance (towards the top of the plot) and large magnitude of change (towards the sides of the plot) are considered to be the most interesting and relevant.
  
  - Points in the upper-right and upper-left corners of the plot represent genes that are significantly differentially expressed between conditions, with those in the upper-right indicating upregulated genes and those in the upper-left indicating downregulated genes.
