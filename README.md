# The Cancer Study Repository

The Cancer Study Repository is a comprehensive collection of resources, datasets, code, and documentation aimed at facilitating research and analysis in the field of cancer biology and oncology. This repository serves as a centralized hub for researchers, clinicians, and data scientists to collaborate, share insights, and advance our understanding of cancer.

## Important Concepts 
1. **Gene Symbol:** This column contains symbols representing genes, typically short identifiers used to represent genes in various databases and analyses.
2. **GeneID:** This column contains the unique identifiers associated with genes. In this dataset, it appears to be using Ensembl gene IDs, which are standardized identifiers for genes in the Ensembl database.
3. **Median Tumor:** This column likely represents the median expression level of each gene in tumor samples. It's a numeric value representing the median expression level.
4. **Median Normal:** This column likely represents the median expression level of each gene in normal (non-tumor) samples. Similar to "MedianTumor", it's a numeric value representing the median expression level.
5. **Log2Fold Change:** This column typically represents the log2-fold change in gene expression between tumor and normal samples. It's a measure of how much the expression of a gene changes between the two conditions.
6. **adjp:** This column likely contains adjusted p-values associated with each gene, often used in statistical analyses to determine if the observed differences in gene expression are statistically significant after adjusting for multiple testing.

1. `Datasets:` The repository hosts a diverse range of high-quality datasets sourced from reputable sources, including genomic data, clinical data, imaging data, and more. These datasets cover various cancer types, stages, and demographics, providing valuable resources for analysis and modeling.

2. `Analysis Tools:` A curated selection of analysis tools, scripts, and algorithms tailored for cancer research is included in the repository. These tools assist researchers in processing, analyzing, and interpreting complex datasets, enabling them to uncover patterns, biomarkers, and potential therapeutic targets.

3. `Documentation:` Detailed documentation accompanies the datasets and tools, offering guidance on data formats, preprocessing steps, analysis methodologies, and best practices. This documentation ensures reproducibility and transparency in research efforts and facilitates knowledge sharing among the community.

4. `Tutorials and Examples:` The repository features tutorials, case studies, and example analyses to help users get started with utilizing the datasets and tools effectively. These resources provide step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and visualizations to illustrate common analytical workflows and techniques.

5. `Community Collaboration:` Researchers are encouraged to contribute their own datasets, tools, and insights to the repository, fostering a collaborative environment for knowledge exchange and discovery. Contributions undergo review and validation processes to maintain the quality and integrity of the repository.

6. `Version Control:` The repository leverages version control systems such as Git to track changes, revisions, and contributions over time. This ensures transparency, accountability, and traceability of modifications made to the datasets, tools, and documentation.
